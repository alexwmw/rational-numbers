### Comments to grader:

	I'm not happy with my constructor. I spent a long time thinking about the rather cryptic comments in the discussion forum about cakes and toppings, trying to figure out just how I could use the Reduce() function in the constructor but I just ended up going a bit mad. I thought that maybe there needed to be some intermediary 'UnreducedRationalNumber' class, or have the numerator/denominator as a separate class, but I could not figure it out. I hope my solution is at least immutable.

I added a lot more operators/implicit conversions just for fun. I know they aren't part of the spec but it made sense to me given this is essentially a new value type, and I got a lot out of delving into the documentation on the different types and the IConvertible and IComparable interfaces, which I thought about implementing. So I hope that won't be marked negatively.

I could have added more tests but I spent so long on this I just had to call it a day.
